🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using CT Scan Images
This project uses deep learning to classify lung CT scan images into three categories — Normal, Benign, and Malignant — to assist in early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.


📂 File Overview
Lung_Cancer_Code.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
