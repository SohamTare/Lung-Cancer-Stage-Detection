# Lung-Cancer-Stage-Detection
This project focuses on detecting lung cancer and classifying it into three categories — Benign, Malignant, and Normal — using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on CT scan images and aims to assist in the early diagnosis and classification of lung cancer stages.
